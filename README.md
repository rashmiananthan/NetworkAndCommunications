NetworkAndCommunications
========================
The goal of this project is to simulate the classic Ethernet using socket API programming through client / server application. Stations are connected through the communication bus and the information is passed from one station to another through the bus. Collisions have been simulated and the wait time before transmitting has been implemented using the Binary Exponential Backoff algorithm.
